CloverOS GNU/Linux is scripts that creates a Gentoo image and a packages repo (Binhost) that contains unique USE flags and CFLAGS. It aims to be an out of the box desktop distro. You can download CloverOS GNU/Linux here https://github.com/chiru-no/cloveros/releases

## FAQ

### Is this an overlay?
No, this uses regular Gentoo Portage only. Same versions and USE flag options.

### What makes CloverOS different/special/why is it made/what is it/who/where/when/how

CloverOS is a pre-riced, out-of-the-box Gentoo that's by /g/, for /g/. It's as close to default Gentoo as possible, with all of the configuration made in `/etc/portage/make.conf` unlike other Gentoo-based distros like Sabayon. The scripts can be used to install it to hard drive, generate a LiveCD and create the CloverOS repo. The CloverOS repo is built with custom CFLAGS for optimum performance, and the USE flags are configured for desktop use. It focuses on speed and low ram usage, doesn't have systemd or other service bloat, and has software out of the box. There's some dotfiles in the home directory by default to save time. CloverOS should be an all-around good desktop distro while remaining simple. The default WM is twm, which allows you to move, resize, minimize/restore windows and launch programs.

If you use Gentoo, you'll probably come to a similar conclusion as CloverOS (package.use, installed packages). The original goal was to be similar to CrunchBang/BunsenLabs, but with Gentoo instead of Debian. This has some speed and memory advantages, as well as including programs and configuration for the average /g/ user.

### Why twm?

Low ram footprint. You can move windows by holding alt+leftclick, resize windows with alt+rightclick and close windows with ctrl+alt+rightclick. The taskbar minimizes and restores windows. twm's settings are in `~/.twmrc`.

### What programs does this come with?

Terminal - urxvt

File manager - xfe

Wifi configuration - wpa_gui

Browser - firefox

Text editor - emacs

Graphic editor - gimp

Video player - smplayer / mpv

FTP client - filezilla

Torrent client - rtorrent

IRC client - weechat

### Installing a DE
After you log in and the "Start X?" dialog pops up, instead of y/n, type one of the WM options and hit y when it asks to install.

### Package isn't available
Make an issue so I can add the package. In the meantime, edit /etc/portage/make.conf and edit the following line:

`EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="--keep-going=y --autounmask-write=y --jobs=2 -G"`

to

`EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="--keep-going=y --autounmask-write=y --jobs=2"`

This disables the binhost and uses Portage's ebuilds for packages.

### How do I install systemd and pulseaudio?

I am proud to announce that CloverOS is 100% Poettering-free.
